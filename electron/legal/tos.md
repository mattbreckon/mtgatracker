# Terms of Services

MTGATracker's core contributors ("us", "we", "our") manage source code ("the code"), distribute the

MTGATracker's Terms of Services (this document, or, "Terms") contain the terms of using MTGATracker,
MTGATracker: Inspector, and any other tools or services MTGATracker may
provide. These Terms serve as a binding contract; please read

While you must agree to our Terms of Services in order to use MTGATracker services,

Before using your information for any purposes outside of fulfilling the contract outlined in our Terms of Services,
we will ask for your consent. Please see our Privacy Policy for more information about how we use the information you
provide to us as a result of using MTGATracker services.

analytic MTGA content (written or otherwise) alongside anonymized aggregate data, for public display.
